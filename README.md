# haskell-scheme

Source files from following the [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) tutorial and [haskell-scheme](https://github.com/geohot/haskell-scheme) repository.
None of the exercises are complete, only the code from the base tutorial is written.
